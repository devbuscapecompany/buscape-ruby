== BuscaPé

'Beware: This gem is under development and has not been tested on production environment yet.'

This is the lightweight wrapper for BuscaPé API. (http://developer.buscape.com)

= How to install?

Simple as: 

  gem install buscape

= How to use?

First instantiate a new 'Buscape::Base' object with two parameters (application_id, sandbox? (default: false)), for example:

  b = Buscape::Base.new("you_application_id")

Then you can use like this:

  b.category(77).products

This get all products in the cellphone category. Or like this:

	b.keyword("Apple").products

This get all products using the keyword "Apple"

Easy, huh? :P
